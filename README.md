## Strategies

## Entrainment

One of the easiest ways to sync the left and right hemispheres of your brain is through binaural beats. This involves delivering sound waves of sightly different frequencies through headphones into each each to produce brainwave entrainment that follows the difference in hertz between each frequency. 
So if one ear is hearing 100 HZ and the other is hearing 107 HZ, there is a difference of 7 HZ and your brain will entrain (or follow) the frequency of 7 HZ, thus falling into theta brainwave frequency. Read more about brainwave frequencies here.
I will evaluate to see if this also works with rythimic light [See](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737907/).


## Creating a Project

You will need to add the FastLed library

## Research

### Brainwave Frequences

| Brain Wave | Frequency | Details |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Gamma |  38 to 100 HZ | Associated with active thought. |
| Beta | 12 to 38 HZ  | Beta state is the dominant state of the alert, waking mind. |
| Alpha | 8 to 12 HZ |  Alpha waves and slower and higher in amplitude than beta waves. Alpha state is a relaxed and usually meditative state.   |
| Theta |  3 to 8 HZ | Theta brainwaves are of greater amplitude to alpha and even slower. Usually, theta brainwaves occur when you are in a dreaming state of sleeping and in deep meditation. |
| Delta |  .5 to 3 HZ | Delta brainwaves are of higher amplitude than beta. Slow, loud and deep â€” like a drum beat. They are created in deep, dreamless sleep and in the deepest meditations. |
